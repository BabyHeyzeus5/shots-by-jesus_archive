## About Me

I am Andrew Jesus, a passionate photographer and aspiring programmer. This website showcases my work and the journey I am on in both photography and technology.

### My Journey

Photography has always been a part of my life. I picked up my first camera during my early teens, and ever since, I have been captivated by the art of capturing moments. 

Programming has allowed me to bring my creative ideas to life through technology. I enjoy building applications that can enhance the user experience and share my passion for photography.
